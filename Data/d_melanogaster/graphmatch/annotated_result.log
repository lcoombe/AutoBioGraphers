Result 1 - score: 1584.663723

Matches: (query \ corresponding vertex)
Rac3 	 7227.FBpp0304252
JNK 	 7227.FBpp0079676
RalGDS 	 7227.FBpp0303219
Ral 	 7227.FBpp0070558

RalBP1 	 7227.FBpp0083406
Rac1 	 7227.FBpp0304252

NOTES:
Above lists all of the nodes in the query which have a corresponding vertex in the output subgraph.
The query node is on the left, and the corresponding vertex in G to that query vertex is listed on the right on the same line.
The corresponding vertex names are Ensembl accession numbers, so if you search each of them on: http://uswest.ensembl.org/index.html and filter by the appropriate species (drosophila melanogster here), then you can get information like the common name of the gene, more information about what is known about the function, etc.

NOTES:
Here, each edge in the query graph that is represented in the resulting subgraph is listed at the beginning of each line. The edge in the subgraph that corresponds to the query edge is listed on the same line.
Ie. 
Rac3	--	JNK		7227.FBpp0304252	--	7227.FBpp0079676
Here, Rac3 and JNK have an edge between them in the query graph.
7227.FBpp0304252 and 7227.FBpp0079676 are in G (and the output subgraph), and there is a direct edge between them. As you can see from the 'matches' section above, 7227.FBpp0304252 corresponds to Rac3 and 7227.FBpp0079676 corresponds to JNK.

The Rac3	--	RalGDS line shows an example of seeing an indel vertex.
