**EXAMPLES OF HOW TO GENERATE INPUT DATA FOR GRAPHMATCH**

File Sources:
stringdb to get the protein.links file, as well as the protein.sequences.fa file
Manually concantenated query proteins to a fasta file using the links on the KEGG page


Formatting protein links, and filtering the protein sequences to only include sequences still in filtered file:
(Used 900 as a cutoff here, but stringdb says any interactions with score over 700 are high quality, so we can play around with this cutoff)

[lcoombe@yqs-centos m_musculus]$ cat mm_protein.links_raw.txt|perl -ne 'chomp; @a=split(/\s+/); if($a[2]>900){print "$_\n";} ' > mm_protein.links_scoreOver900.txt
[lcoombe@yqs-centos m_musculus]$ python ../filterSequences.py mm_protein.links_scoreOver900.txt mm_protein.sequences_raw.fa > mm_protein.sequences_scoreOver900.fa


Formatting to G graph input:
[lcoombe@yqs-centos m_musculus]$ cat mm_protein.links_scoreOver900.txt |perl -ne 'chomp; @a=split(/\s+/); print "$a[0]\t$a[1]\n"; ' > graph_input_900

On GSC Server, BLAST:

1. Make BLAST DB with the protein sequences
[lcoombe@yqs-centos m_musculus]$ /projects/rwarren_prj/solexa/HLAminer_dev/HLAminer_v1.3dev/bin/formatdb -p T -i mm_protein.sequences_scoreOver900.fa

2. Run BLAST
# Fields: Query id, Subject id, % identity, alignment length, mismatches, gap openings, q. start, q. end, s. start, s. end, e-value, bit s
core
[lcoombe@yqs-centos m_musculus]$ /projects/rwarren_prj/solexa/HLAminer_dev/HLAminer_v1.3dev/bin/blastall -p blastp -m8 -d mm_protein.sequences_scoreOver900.fa -i ../pan_data/graphmatch/G0_proteinSequences.fa > mm_blast_900.out

3. Format to corr file (Used 0.00001 as a E-value cut-off, but this can be played with as well)
[lcoombe@yqs-centos m_musculus]$ cat mm_blast_900.out |perl -ne 'chomp; @a=split(/\t/); if($a[10] < 0.00001){print "$a[0]\t$a[1]\t$a[10]\n";} ' > mm_corr900.txt

4. Identify duplicates in corr file (Then, deleted them by hand -- don't want multiple correspondence entries between the same two proteins)
[lcoombe@hpce705 m_musculus]$ cat mm_corr900.txt |perl -ne 'chomp; @a=split(/\t/); print "$a[1]\n"; ' | uniq -d


Made the G0 graph input by hand
