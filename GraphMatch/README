Test usage:
python GraphMatch.py  MetabolicNetwork/query MetabolicNetwork/input MetabolicNetwork/corr
python  GraphMatch.py -ip -0.2 -np -7 test-data/query test-data/input test-data/corr_short

**NOTE: I was getting weird errors based on the ":" in the protein names. I just changed them to "-", and I didn't seem to get the same errors
